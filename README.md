# Chainlink hardhat implementation

# QuickStart

Set your `ALCHEMY_MAINNET_RPC_URL` [environment variable.](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html). You can get one for free at [Alchemy's site.](https://alchemyapi.io/). You'll also need your `MNEMONIC` which is your 12 word seed phrase from you wallet, ie metamask. 

```
export MNEMONIC='cat dog frog....'
export ALCHEMY_MAINNET_RPC_URL='www.infura.io/asdfadsfafdadf'
```

Then run

1. `git clone https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/chainlink-hardhat`
2. `cd chainlink-hardhat`
3. `yarn`
4. `npx hardhat test`

### You can start your own hardhat repo by following along in the [hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/)

This repo makes use of hardhat's forking mechanism. This allows us to test forked versions of what we are working on, even mainnet!

`npx hardhat test` makes use of this, and in the `hardhat.config.js` file, you'll see it has a `forking` url. This will fork the network from our RPC_URL everytime we use that network. 

# Deploy 

Set your `KOVAN_RPC_URL` [environment variable.](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html)

`npx hardhat run --network kovan scripts/deploy.js`
